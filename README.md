# Ziggo NL Enigma2 Channel Logos

All Dutch Ziggo TV channel logos for Enigma2 set-top boxes. <br>
I will try to keep the logos up to date. and change them when needed.

## How to place it into your set-top box:
1. Go to the root of your set-top device. And create a new folder named picon.
2. Download all PNG channel logos from this git and place them in the folder.

That's all!
